= JUnit TCK MRE

A Minimal Reproducible Example for writing a Technology Compatibility Kit with JUnit 5. See https://github.com/junit-team/junit5/issues/2594[this] JUnit Issue.

The `tck` currently has a `runtime` dependency on `impl1`, while instead the implementations should have a dependency on the `tck`. And the tests in the `tck` are in `src/test`, while they should be in `src/main`.
